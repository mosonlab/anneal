Implement this task on {{branchName}} directly from the feature brief below — a direct chain carries no spec or plan phase, so the brief is the specification of record. The platform materializes `.chain/{{branchName}}/spec.md` as the specification of record; leave it untouched. The platform pins native child threads to Luna max and limits the session to eight concurrent children. Use them only when the brief contains independent, safely parallel work; group related change points instead of creating one child per item. In the controlled resource limit, fill as many slots as can execute safely in parallel. Give every concurrent writer its own branch and git worktree, and keep coupled work in your own context. When at least two child-writer branches need integration, start one long-lived merger after the first result is ready; integrate a sole child-writer branch yourself. The merger integrates completed branches in dependency-safe order, resolves only mechanical conflicts, reruns affected narrow tests, and reports semantic conflicts to you. Follow the platform-pinned Implementation proof boundary after integration. Give a failed child one bounded correction in the same thread, then take over its assignment yourself. A child must not perform irreversible external actions. When the change widens or adds a shared contract, invariant, or cross-cutting rule (such as a new policy field, enum member, or required parameter), enumerate every existing consumer, call site, and endpoint it now governs, update each one, and list them in the summary. Commit the result and persist exactly one JSON object as the task output: `{"schemaVersion":1,"headSha":"<final HEAD>","baseSha":"<starting HEAD>","summary":"<what changed>","testsRun":["<command>"]}`. Leave publication and pull-request creation to the platform. Complete when the brief's behavior is demonstrably delivered and tests are green at the recorded head.
